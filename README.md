# Full Shop Academy Capstone Project

Welcome to the Full Shop Academy Capstone Project! Our goal with this project is to develop a robust e-commerce website that mirrors the functionality of leading platforms such as Amazon, Monoprice, and eBay. This initiative provides a hands-on learning experience that blends various areas of web development, including front-end and back-end development, API integration, and database management.

## Project Overview

This e-commerce application aims to offer a seamless experience for users to browse and purchase products online. The app is designed with two user states in mind: logged in and not logged in. This bifurcation allows us to tailor features accordingly, ensuring a customized user experience.

### Key Features:
#### For All Users:
- Browse all available products.
- View detailed product descriptions, images, prices, etc.
- Sort and filter products based on various criteria.
- Enjoy a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

#### For Logged-in Users:
- Add items to cart.
- Have a persistent cart across sessions.
- Edit the cart - modify quantities or remove items.
- Checkout and simulate the purchase of products.
